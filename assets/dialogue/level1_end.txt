scientist###sad###SIG11###It died.
scientist###serious###SIG11###The spectrometer is operating the {COLOR=#000000}life obsidian{CLEARCOLOR} as designed.
scientist###serious###SIG11###However,{WAIT} I did not anticipate the specimen to behave this way.
scientist###serious###0###First of all, each of its segments can only be stabilized for about {COLOR=#03cafc}10 seconds{CLEARCOLOR} at time.
scientist###serious###0###Second, each stabilization severely damages its internal organs.
scientist###serious###0###Based on the damage, each segment can probably only take {COLOR=#03cafc}3 stabilizations{CLEARCOLOR} before it is killed.
scientist###serious###0###Last, the specimen can only be put under control by {COLOR=#03cafc}spontaneously eliminating all of the instabilities{CLEARCOLOR}.
scientist###serious###0###...
scientist###serious###0###Very important findings.
scientist###serious###0###{COLOR=#d69267}Specimen one{CLEARCOLOR} you served your purpose.
scientist###normal###0###I should rest for the day.{WAIT} Operating the next specimen will only be harder.
