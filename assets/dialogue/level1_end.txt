scientist###serious###SIG111###The spectrometer is operating the {COLOR=#000000}life obsidian{CLEARCOLOR} as designed.
scientist###serious###SIG111###However,{WAIT} I did not anticipate the specimen to behave this way.
scientist###serious###0###First of all, each of its body parts can only be stabilized for about {COLOR=#03cafc}a few seconds{CLEARCOLOR} at time.
scientist###serious###0###Second, each stabilization severely damages its internal organs.
scientist###serious###0###Based on the damage, each body part can at most survive {COLOR=#03cafc}3 stabilizations{CLEARCOLOR}.
scientist###serious###0###Last, the specimen can only be put under control by {COLOR=#03cafc}simultaneously eliminating all of the instabilities{CLEARCOLOR}.

scientist###serious###0###Very important findings.
